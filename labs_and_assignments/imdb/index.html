                <em>Celeste</em> is a platformer game where the player takes on the role of Madeline; a young girl who, after a major anxiety attack, drops everything in her life and travels to mystical Mt <em>Celeste</em> in order to attempt to climb to the summit.
                Along the way she learns about herself, processes trauma, and makes a handful of friends including: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A strange woman who lives on the mountain and guides her on her journey</li>
                <li>A young american influencer with a passion for photography</li>
                <li>A kindly but volitile ghost who runs an abandoned inn</li>
                <li>A part of herself that she is running from, given physical form by the powers of the mountain</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The game is a tough as nails platformer with a forgiving learning curve and many additional challenges that, through its gameplay and cutscenes, explores themes of anxiety, depression, dysphoria, and coping with loss.
