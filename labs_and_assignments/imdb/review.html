            <h2>A Review of <em>Celeste</em></h2>
            <h4>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</h4>

            <p>
                <em>Celeste</em> is a wonderfully tight platformer with a gripping story, compelling themes, and satisfying "easy to learn hard to master" controls.
                The game's controls are simple enough, with only 4 core actions available to you: move, jump, airdash, and climb, but manages to itterate on these concepts in new and unique ways constantly.
                Each level introduces a couple unique ideas that are used throughout with increasing complexity to keep things fresh, and just as you're getting comfortable with how they work, they are dropped for the next level's new exciting ideas.
                The story is simple, but heartfelt, and walks a thin line between cozy nostalgia for a bygone era that maybe never existed and stomach turning anxiety and introspection.
                While the deeper meanings are obscured behind allegory and thus open to interpretation, there seem to be strong themes of anxiety, depression, and gender dysphoria turning into self love and acceptance.

                <h4>Some <em>Celeste</em> trivia & fun facts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designer Maddy Thorson has gone on record saying that while she never intended for Celeste to be a trans story, in retrospect, it clearly was, and the process of making <em>Celeste</em> was pivotal in her own coming out as trans</li>
                    <li>Madeline is also a playable character in the Swith version of Towerfall, one of Maddy's earlier games</li>
                    <li>Madeline, often shortened to Maddie in game, is likely a self insert of creator Maddy Thorson.</li>
                    <li>One of the games hidden crystal hearts is found by crouching on a white box for roughly 5 seconds resulting in the player falling into the background.  This is a reference to an identical secret in Super Mario Bros 3, world 1 which gifts the player a warp whistle.</li>
                    <li><em>Celeste</em> composer Lena Raine went on to make music for many other games, including Minecraft</li>
